# TRAMA
TRAMA is a MetaTrader 4 trend indicator inspired by Trend Regularity Adaptive Moving Average on TradingView. It computes an adaptive moving average (TRAMA) that dynamically adjusts to the market’s regularity. If the market trades above the TRAMA, the trend is considered up; below it indicates a downtrend.
